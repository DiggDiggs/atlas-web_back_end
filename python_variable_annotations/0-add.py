def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # This is the function definition for 'add'.
    # It takes two arguments, 'a' and 'b', both of type 'float'.
    # It returns a value of type 'float'.

    return a + b  
    # The 'return' statement sends back the result of 'a + b' to where the function was called.
    # This line performs the addition of 'a' and 'b' and returns the sum.
